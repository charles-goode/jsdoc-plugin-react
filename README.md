# jsdoc-react
jsdoc plugin to add parsed react component information to documentation

Uses [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen/tree/main) to parse source files for react component and their prop-types.

Adds HTML table containing the prop info for each component parsed

Does not currently implement a jsdoc template

Inpsired by [better-docs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs) creating an @component tag for jsdoc. Too many additional features for a simple use case.
